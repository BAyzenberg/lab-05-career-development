====

## To Submit this Assignment
  * fork this repository
  * write all of your code in a directory named `lab-` + `<your name>` **e.g.** `lab-duncan`
  * push to your repository
  * submit a pull request to this repository
  * submit a link to your PR in canvas
  * write a question and observation on canvas

## Description
  * write at least three tests for each method that you've written
  * complete the List data structure by adding a pop method
  * implement `forEach()` and `filter()` as pure methods on the List prototype; from your whiteboard exercise
  * implement `map()` and `reduce()` as pure methods on the List prototype
  * in comments above or within each function, note the Big-O runtime

## Bonus Points:
  * most of our current List implementation will have linear / O(n) runtime
    * refactor the List data structure however you like for the methods to have constant / O(1)
